- 👋 Hi, I’m Ilia @Krachkovskii!
- I am a BIM Specialist working with 2Dto6D from Florence, Italy.
- My main focus is architectural design; I am skilled in modelling, designing, documenting and automating stuff in Revit
- In 2020, I started learning to work with Dynamo, and in 2022 I wqas brutally forced to make some bits using 🐍 Python 🐍 
- Now there was no way back - every project is a fun challenge where I can learn something new!
- I'm using github mainly to brag about my achievments and to document my progress.
